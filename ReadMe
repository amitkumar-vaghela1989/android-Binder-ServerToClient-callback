As I am new to android and trying to learn binder interface. I have written a demo
server and client using some reference availbale.
Few demo/test applications are available on internet that shows how client can connect with server using  
binder that is a remote procedue call, but if there a need other way around and Server needs to
give callback to a connected client on certain event then this example serves the purpose.

This code will server as a template so no need to go deep in underlying mechanism and can be directly used.

Compilation
----------------------------------------------------------------
It has a Android.mk file so after compiling using standard command it will create 
helloserve and helloclient applications.

How to run server client Application
----------------------------------------------------------------
1) Do adb shell and run server.
   ie. ./helloserver
2) Open new terminal and do adb shell and run client.
   ie. ./helloclient
3) When client runs it will set the callback in server, so server will have callback reference.
4) Now go to terminal where server is running, enter a value. This server will call the client function
sending specific value to client.

Run it and play around it, it will give more understanding.

 I hope that this code will help others from scratching their head a lot.
